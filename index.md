I am a computer engineering major at CSUF. I started my degree in the fall of 2024, and plan on completing my degree in the fall of 2027.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Blackjack Files (Lab 6, Part 2)
  I enjoyed this lab because it took a lot of thought to figure out how to correctly calculate the score of each hand, which was a fun challenge that helped me grow more confident in my coding abilities. The learning goal of this lab was to learn how to use if statements to check if the proper conditions were meant to run a program successfully. If these conditions were not met, then an error message would be printed, otherwise the program would return the accurate score of a given blackjack hand.

* Street Name Lab (Lab 7)
  This lab was one of my favorites because I had to use trial and error to properly program the if statements in the parking functions, which was a rewarding experience that ultimately led to great satisfaction after I finally programmed each of the functions correctly. The goal of this lab was to familiarize with boolean logic and if statement conditions by coding functions which would determine whether or not someone is allowed to park on a street at any given day and time. Once the functions were programmed, we then coded the primary file with error statements if the user did not provide the right arguments (street name, day, hour, minute), and if every argument was correct then it would use your arguments and the functions to determine if you could park on that street.

* Game and Secret (Lab 9, Part 2)
  I liked this lab because it showed me that there are many ways to program the same thing, since we had done a previous lab with the same secret number game. The point of this lab was to use I/O stream (ifstream and ofstream) to program a game where a player enters a secret number that another player has to guess. Ifstream would be used to read what the secret number input was and determine if it was valid, then ofstream was used to output the secret number into game.cc so that the second player could guess the secret number. If the player guessed correctly, they would be told so, otherwise they would be told what the secret number actually was.
